# PELUX, an Automotive Reference Integration Platform

PELUX is an agnostic reference integration platform that enables you to build
and develop automotive Linux-based systems without vendor lock-in. As an open
source solution accelerator, PELUX helps you prototype and create
production-ready, converged automotive systems, including advanced
driver-assistance systems (ADAS), telematics units and in-vehicle infotainment
systems.

The platform, built with Yocto, is complemented with the Luxoft Software
Factory (SWF), which provides tools and processes for more effective development.
This includes project blueprints and documentation for embedded Linux devices,
which are tailored specifically to the needs in the automotive industry. PELUX is
designed to easily integrate leading third-party open source or proprietary
automotive-grade components, including open source projects like GENIVI&reg; and
AGL. As a reference UI, PELUX also integrates components from Qt Automotive
Suite.

PELUX is founded on GENIVI&reg; specifications and is certified for compliance,
with a guarantee that it will follow future open source compliance specification
releases. Our internationally recognized expertise in FOSS license compliance
allows PELUX to be used to create new business models with confidence. Luxoft
understands how secure the entire supply chain of complex automotive software
projects must be, with each incorporating various commercial and open source
licenses. Our broad knowledge of best practices from the license compliance
community enables visibility into the commercialization process of PELUX and our
software development processes. These tools and know-how are embedded in PELUX
and the Luxoft Software Factory.
